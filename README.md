# Convex support vector regression
This repository contains codes for MC simulations and experiments in Convex support vector regression ([preprint available on arXiv](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2209.12538)).
# Functions
In functionall folder, we list all functions used in experiements.
* CNLS.py, CR.py, CSVR.py: three methods compared in paper.
* DGP.py: data generate process.
* MC.py: MC simulations, return MSE for each method.
* toolbox.py: cross validation for tuning parameters.
* constant.py and tool.py: support files from [Pystoned package](https://github.com/ds2010/pyStoNED).
